\title{Impute Missing Data with Feature Elimination}
\usage{
impute_with_feature_elimination(df, method, n_datasets = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with missing values to be imputed.}

\item{max_attempts}{The maximum number of attempts to impute the data by
eliminating features. Defaults to the number of columns in `df`.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with imputed values. If imputation is successful, it returns
        the imputed dataframe. If all features are eliminated without successful
        imputation, the function stops with an error.
}
\description{
Attempts to impute missing data in a dataframe using the Amelia package. If Amelia
fails due to too many variables, the function iteratively removes the least important
feature (based on an importance number appended to the feature name) and retries
the imputation. The process continues until successful imputation or all features are exhausted.
}
\examples{
# Assuming df is a dataframe with missing values and appended importance numbers
imputed_df <- impute_with_feature_elimination(df)
}
