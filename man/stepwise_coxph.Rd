\arguments{
\item{Time}{The time variable name for right-censored data (time to event).}

\item{T1}{The start time variable name for interval-censored data.}

\item{T2}{The end time variable name for interval-censored data.}

\item{Status}{The event status variable name.}

\item{variable.list}{A vector of candidate variable names to be considered in the model.}

\item{in.variable}{A vector of variable names to always include in the model. Defaults to "NULL".}

\item{data}{The data frame containing the variables.}

\item{sle}{The significance level for entry in the model during stepwise selection. Defaults to 0.15.}

\item{sls}{The significance level for staying in the model during stepwise selection. Defaults to 0.15.}

\item{vif.threshold}{The threshold for the variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity. Defaults to 999.}
}
\value{
A vector of the names of the selected variables.
}
\description{
Performs stepwise variable selection (both forward and backward) in a Cox proportional hazards model.
It handles right-censored data (using Time and Status) or interval-censored data (using T1, T2, and Status).
The function returns the names of the variables selected by the stepwise procedure.
